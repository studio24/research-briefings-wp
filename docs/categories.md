# Categories mapping

Research Briefings topics are mapped to Wordpress categories within the crosstagggin tool called *Research Briefings*. This tool is available in the wordpress admin panel.

## How the tool works

Initially, all the imported data is assigned to the category *Research Briefing*. The topics of each custom post data is then translated to the list of categories based on the topic url which represents the identifier. 

If the topic isn't matched, it will appear as a new category under the _Unassigned Research Briefings Topics_ column. This can be dragged into its own category or an existing one.
